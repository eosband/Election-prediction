    "\n",
    "<p> The final project is about conducting a real-world machine learning project on your own, with everything that is involved. Unlike in the programming projects 1-5, where we gave you all the scaffolding and you just filled in the blanks, you now start from scratch. The programming project provide templates for how to do this, and the most recent video lectures summarize some of the tricks you will need (e.g. feature normalization, feature construction). So, this final project brings realism to how you will use machine learning in the real world.  </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The task you will work on is forecasting election results. Economic and sociological factors have been widely used when making predictions on the voting results of US elections. Economic and sociological factors vary a lot among counties in the United States. In addition, as you may observe from the election map of recent elections, neighbor counties show similar patterns in terms of the voting results. In this project you will bring the power of machine learning to make predictions for the county-level election results using Economic and sociological factors and the geographic structure of US counties. </p>\n",

    "<h3>Your Task:</h3>\n",
    "Plase read the project description PDF file carefully and make sure you write your code and answers to all the questions in this Jupyter Notebook. Your answers to the questions are a large portion of your grade for this final project. Please import the packages in this notebook and cite any references you used as mentioned in the project description. You need to print this entire Jupyter Notebook as a PDF file and submit to Gradescope and also submit the ipynb runnable version to Canvas for us to run.\n",

    "The final project dataset and template jupyter notebook will be due on <strong>December 15th</strong> . Note that <strong>no late submissions will be accepted</strong>  and you cannot use any of your unused slip days before.\n",

I did this using the Embedding Libraries that pytorch has supplied for me. I also converted the income feature into an integer since it was primarily a string. I also made the target equal to 1 for Democrat and 0 for GOP to complete the binary classification. This calculation was made by finding the majority of Democrats or GOP. \n",

I began with NLLLoss but changed to CrossEntropyLoss to add the softmax hidden layer. Additionally, I started using Stochastic Gradient Descent, but found that it was not learning fast enough and after I switched to torch's Adam optimizer, it was learning much faster per epoch.\n",
