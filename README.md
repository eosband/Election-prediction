# Election-prediction

**About**

Worked in collaboration with Eddie Freedman and Anthony Cuturuffo to create multiple machine learning algorithms to predict the county-level vote results of the 2016 General Election. 

Created as a final project for *CS 4780: Introduction to Machine Learning* taught at Cornell University in fall 2020. Scored a 105/100 on this project, with the extra 5 bonus points awarded for surpassing 80% accuracy on the hidden Kaggle test set. Also scored in the top 10 of over 150 teams on the public Kaggle set.
