    "\n",
    "<p> The final project is about conducting a real-world machine learning project on your own, with everything that is involved. Unlike in the programming projects 1-5, where we gave you all the scaffolding and you just filled in the blanks, you now start from scratch. The programming project provide templates for how to do this, and the most recent video lectures summarize some of the tricks you will need (e.g. feature normalization, feature construction). So, this final project brings realism to how you will use machine learning in the real world.  </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The task you will work on is forecasting election results. Economic and sociological factors have been widely used when making predictions on the voting results of US elections. Economic and sociological factors vary a lot among counties in the United States. In addition, as you may observe from the election map of recent elections, neighbor counties show similar patterns in terms of the voting results. In this project you will bring the power of machine learning to make predictions for the county-level election results using Economic and sociological factors and the geographic structure of US counties. </p>\n",

    "<h3>Your Task:</h3>\n",
    "Plase read the project description PDF file carefully and make sure you write your code and answers to all the questions in this Jupyter Notebook. Your answers to the questions are a large portion of your grade for this final project. Please import the packages in this notebook and cite any references you used as mentioned in the project description. You need to print this entire Jupyter Notebook as a PDF file and submit to Gradescope and also submit the ipynb runnable version to Canvas for us to run.\n",

    "The final project dataset and template jupyter notebook will be due on <strong>December 15th</strong> . Note that <strong>no late submissions will be accepted</strong>  and you cannot use any of your unused slip days before.\n",

    "1. To preprocess the label, we created a new binary value that equals 1 when the number of DEM votes was greater than the number of GOP votes, and 0 otherwise. In terms of features, we extracted the state abbreviation from the \"County\" column via substring selection and assigned each number to a number from 1 to 50. From there, all feature values (which excludes FIPS) were standardized according to a standard normal distribution.\n",

It could also take into account the prior class probabilities, which in the end allowed us to essentially assign a greater weight to predict 1 than 0, and thus gave us such good accuracy. Additionally, most of our data was real-valued, so it was quite practical. These characteristics allowed us to assume that our data was normally distributed, which is an assumption of the LDA method. And clearly the model was quite a success.\n",

Afterwards, we selected the model/parameters that achieved the greatest validation score. We also played around with different solvers, as well as using quadratic analysis rather than linear, but none of this realistically increased our performanc\n",

    "1) We managed to improve performance a significant amount. What was most surprising was that we always thought the neural network would by far surpass the accuracy of any other type of model, and so we initially created our basic LDA just as a dummy essentially. But after its success on the basic solution, we decided to delve deeper and see how far we could push our accuracy. In the end, after solving many, many bugs, we ended up reaching 84% accuracy on Kaggle, as seen below, compared to around 77% on the basic solution.\n",

    "2) To do this, we tried a couple of things, but ended up including all but one of them in our basic solution as described above. Thus the only unique element we added was incorporating both graph and 2012 data into our algorithm. We first hypothesized that the way surrounding counties voted would probably affect the way the county itself voted. Additionally, we also realized that the *number* of neighboring counties might also give us useful information, since many GOP counties tend to be square-shaped (thus having only 4 neighbors) whereas DEM counties might have weird squiggles and curves and thus would have more neighbors. To implement this, we added two new features: `avg_neighbor` and `num_neighbors`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`num_neighbors` is simply the number of neighbors listed in the graph.csv file. If you look at our code, we had to do an awkward array concatenation since the CSV file could have the given county in either column. Additionally, we had to make sure to remove the county itself from that list, as it was (for some reason) listed as one of its own neighbors. This interestingly gave us a significant bug wherein we were getting around 97% accuracy on our validation but only 73% on Kaggle, but eventually this bug was spotted and the county itself was discarded from computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "`avg_neighbor` is the average prediction of the given county's neighboring counties in either 2016 or 2012. The process was also described above in the code, but we'll explain it here again for ease of the reader. After we had assembled the list of all neighboring county codes, we looked through this list one-by-one and saw whether or not that county was listed in our entire train_2016 dataset. If it was, we added the target 1-0 value to our sum. If it was not in our table, then we looked at the train_2012 dataset, and if it was there, we added that target value to our sum. If it was not there, we did nothing. After we had collected this sum, we divided it by the number of counties found (in either 2016 or 2012 data) to obtain our average neighbor target value. So if all of a given county's neighbors voted democratic in 2016, then its average neighbor score would be 1.\n",
    "Note that this does not actually cause data-leakage into our validation set as we never use the target information of a training example itself, only of its neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize: we had hypotheses about two things that would probably be good features for our dataset, so we added them. We only resorted to using the 2012 dataset when we absolutely had to, i.e. the given county was not available in our 2016 sample. Other than that, we figured adding the 2012 dataset as a whole might bias our predictions a great deal, since we know from experience that voting lines changed a great deal between 2012 and 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "After we assembled lists of each of these features, we added them to their respective dataframes, and normalized the data with a standard scaler as before. Surprisingly enough, adding just these two features managed to increase our prediction score by 7% or so. "
